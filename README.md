# What is LETTERS?
LETTERS is a word puzzle game where players need to create vocabs to fight with monsters and bosses.<br>
The purpose of this game is to win all the fights with the highest score.
# Purpose
I always want to create a MEME word puzzle game with combat system which I thought would fit the requirements for my project during year 1 semester 2.
# Feature
The game will contain 6 normal fights and 2 boss fights.<br>
You will have to create a vocab to be able to inflict damage to a monster.<br>
However, your damage will correlated to the length of the word and also there's a special character which will boost damage further.
